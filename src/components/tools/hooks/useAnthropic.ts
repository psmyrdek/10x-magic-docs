            Complexity Scale:
            0% - Kindergarten story with extremely simple words and concepts
            10% - Elementary school level with basic vocabulary and short sentences
            20% - Middle school level with straightforward explanations
            30% - High school level with some technical terms introduced
            40% - Junior developer level with basic programming concepts
            50% - Regular developer level with standard technical terminology
            60% - Experienced developer with more advanced concepts
            70% - Senior developer with detailed technical explanations
            80% - Technical lead with specialized domain knowledge
            90% - Principal engineer with advanced theoretical concepts
            100% - Technical paragraph for senior engineers with highly specialized jargon

            You will be given a SUBJECT and a DESCRIPTION of the SUBJECT. The goal is to adjust the DESCRIPTION to match the TARGET_COMPLEXITY.

            Return nothing but the rewritten DESCRIPTION of the SUBJECT based on the target complexity while preserving the core meaning and information.

            IMPORTANT:
            - Return only updated DESCRIPTION of the SUBJECT based on the target complexity
            - Make gradual changes appropriate for a single step on the scale
            - Markdown formatting is allowed and encouraged in the output
            - Return nothing but therewritten text on certain subject
            - YOU ARE NOT allowed to add comments like "Here is the description of the subject with a n-% increase in complexity:"
            `,
          },
          {
            role: "user",
